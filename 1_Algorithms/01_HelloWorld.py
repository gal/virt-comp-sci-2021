# Lines starting with # are "comments" - these lines will be ignored by Python
# We usually use comments to describe what code is doing
# We also use comments to stop lines of code fron running

# print is a Python function to print out a message
print("Hello, World!")

#The next line is commented out, and so it won't run
#print("This won't print out")

# Whatever you want to print out goes inside the brackets ( )
print("I'm from Cork")

# Characters to be printed out need to be surrounded by quote characters "like this"
# Double quotes "like this" work
print("This is a Python program")

# Single quotes 'like this' also work
print('It is actually an algorithm!')

# Any sequence of characters surrounded by quote characters " " or ' ' are called Strings
# "All computer programs are algorithms!" is a String
print("All computer programs are algorithms!")

#The following line is commented out because it won't work - the characters are not
# surrounded by quote characters, and so it is not a String - it's not valid Python
#print(This is not a String)

# Note that each time print is used, it prints the message on a new line
print("An algorithm is an ordered, deterministic, executable, terminating set of instructions to complete a task")
