# We store data in programs by using "Variables"
# You can name variables, and they can store Strings, Numbers, and more
# Here we create a variable called "name", and we store the String "Michael" in it
name = "Michael"

#Here we create a variable called "age" and store the integer Number 25 in it
age = 32

# The print function can print whatever data is stored in variables
# Here, we print out the contents of the "name" variable
print(name)

# Here, we print out the contents of the "age" variable
print(age)

# Here, the print function will print each comma-seperated piece of data on one line,
# placing spaces between each piece of data
# The String "Hello! My name is" is the first piece of data
# The variable "name" is the second piece of data
# The String "and I am" is the third piece of data
# The String "years old!" is the fourth and final piece of data
# With the variables above, it will print the String:
# "Hello! My name is Michael and I am 25 years old!"
print("Hello! My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old!")
